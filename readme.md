# BBQ Store

## What is this?

This is my version of a coding challenge that we ask new applicants to complete at the company where I work. I thought it would be fun to complete it and let my coworkers see what it was.

### The Challenge

Here's what we send to our applicants

We're in need of a simple three page website for one of our customers to be able to order ~~tropical fruit~~ **BBQ** for a school fund raiser. We are expecting up to 100 orders.

What we need is:

• Page 1: Product list page to show a list of ~~tropical fruit~~ **BBQ**
o There are 5 fruit total and each of them had a title, price, and a button to "Add to ~~Fruit~~ **BBQ** Cart". Other data is ok but not required.
• Page 2: ~~Fruit~~ **BBQ** Cart. This page shows a list of the items that have been added to the ~~Fruit~~ **BBQ** cart.
o There is field to ask for the person's name, and a button to "Order ~~Fruit~~ **BBQ** now".
o Just knowing the person's name is enough
• Page 3:
o A thank you page that confirms that the order was completed

Using your favorite tools, frameworks, platform, libraries, coding language, flat file or database, can you create this 3 page school website, and provide us with a working example, including source code? The only requirement is that you don’t pick an existing ecommerce solution to build this with.
